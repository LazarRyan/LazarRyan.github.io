Hi, I’m **Ryan Lazar** — a Business Solution Analyst at Deloitte and an M.S. Data Science candidate for Drew University, graduating May 2026. I build data-driven tools that transform raw information into scalable, insightful solutions. Below are a few personal projects I've developed using Python, APIs, automation, and cloud-friendly pipelines.
